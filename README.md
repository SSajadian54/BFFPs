Here, there are two C++  codes which simulate microlensing events due to binary free-floating exoplanetary systems. 
One of them was adjusted to the observations with the Roman microlensing survey toward the Galactic bulge.  

There are some python codes as well.  

BFFPlightA.py and BFFPlightB.py find the best-fitted (extended-source and point-lens ) microlensing models for simulated events.  

In Analyz.py code, some statistical parameters are calculated.  

Mapp2.py plots several maps due to lensing parameters from all possible microlensing events due to binary free-floating planetary systems.  

There are some files contain the results from performing simulations.

The results from this research as a manuscript were submitted.  

In the case that you want to know about these codes please contact me, I will be happy to help.
